# opencv_colourdetection
Real-time color-based object detection using Python and OpenCV. Captures live webcam feed, applies HSV color space thresholding for robust color segmentation, and localizes objects using bounding boxes. Demonstrates classical computer vision techniques, efficient array processing with NumPy, and clean, modular code design.
